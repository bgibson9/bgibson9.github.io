                    Packer in his opening remarks at the Brigham City Utah Temple groundbreaking held Saturday, July 31,
                    2010. President Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and his wife Donna are
                    natives of Brigham City. President Packer had attended elementary school 80 years before on the very
                    site where he stood. He continued, "I can see in my mind's eye a temple sitting here in about two
                    years time. It will be gorgeous, it will be white. You will see in the design of it reflections of
                    previous temples that have been built, particularly the Salt Lake Temple. It will be a beacon from
                    all over the valley." The gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni was set in place on Tuesday, July
                    12, 2011, from about 1:40 to 2:30 p.m. Weather conditions delayed the raising. Surrounding streets
                    were closed to allow the approximately 5,000 spectators to view the proceedings. The exterior finish
                    is precast concrete. The temple was dedicated on 23 September 2012 by Boyd K. Packer.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The Ogden Utah Temple was announced on 24 August 1967. The Ogden Utah was the 14th temple in operation and the 5th temple in Utah. It was the first temple build with 6 ordinance rooms, allowing sessions every 20 minutes all through the day. The temple was dedicated on 18-20 January 1972 by Joseph Fielding Smith. President Harold B. Lee finished the dedicatory prayer when President Smith became weak from standing too long.</p>
                
                <p>The angel Moroni statue was added November 18, 2002. The temple was completely rebuilt and rededicated in 2014 after a three-and-a-half-year renovation project. All landscaping was redone, featuring two beautiful water features on the east and west sides of the temple.The temple sits on 9.96 acres of ground. The exterior finish is granite, quarried and fabricated in China.
                    
                <p>The Ogden Utah Temple servces as a religious centerpiece to downtown Ogden. The Ogden Tabernacle, where many Stake Conferences are held, shares the block.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The Brigham City Utah Temple was announced on 3 October 2009. "I am home," said President Boyd K.
                    Packer in his opening remarks at the Brigham City Utah Temple groundbreaking held Saturday, July 31,
                    2010. President Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and his wife Donna are
                    natives of Brigham City. President Packer had attended elementary school 80 years before on the very
                    site where he stood. He continued, "I can see in my mind's eye a temple sitting here in about two
                    years time. It will be gorgeous, it will be white. You will see in the design of it reflections of
                    previous temples that have been built, particularly the Salt Lake Temple. It will be a beacon from
                    all over the valley." The gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni was set in place on Tuesday, July
                    12, 2011, from about 1:40 to 2:30 p.m. Weather conditions delayed the raising. Surrounding streets
                    were closed to allow the approximately 5,000 spectators to view the proceedings. The exterior finish
                    is precast concrete. The temple was dedicated on 23 September 2012 by Boyd K. Packer.</p>
